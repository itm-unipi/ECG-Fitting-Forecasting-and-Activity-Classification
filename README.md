University Project for "Intelligent Systems" course (MSc Computer Engineering @ University of Pisa). Implementation of ECG fitting, forecasting and activity classification using `MLP` and `RBF neural networks`, `convolutional neural networks`, `recurrent neural networks` and `fuzzy systems`.

## Overview

The aim of the project is to apply **machine learning**, **deep learning** and **fuzzy system** technologies in order to classify **human activities** (such as *walking*, *sitting* and *running*), fit **ECG feature values** (such as *mean* and *standard deviation*) and forecast **ECG values**. To achieve these goals, the following technologies have been used:

* **Multi-layer Perceptron**, **Radial Basis Function** and **Convolutional Neural Network** for ECG feature values fitting
* **Multi-layer Perceptron**, **Fuzzy Inference System** and **Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System** for activity classification
* **Recurrent Neural Network** for ECG forecasting
